| I am glad that the authors have clarified “lensing mass” in the
| text, but I have concerns about this formulation.  It is stated that
| the mass map extends to roughly twice the distance of the outermost
| image.  While this probably encloses most of the total mass of the
| lens galaxy, their halos certainly extend beyond this, creating a
| bias toward lensing masses that are low compared to total mass.
| This also can create a systematic effect where low-redshift lenses
| will have a smaller ratio of Einstein radius to effective radius (or
| halo scale radius), and thus this bias will affect them more.  The
| immediate thought is to extend the mass maps until the mass tiles
| around the edge go to zero, but this creates larger uncertainties
| elsewhere and probably increases computation time.  An alternative
| is to define lensing mass as mass within the Einstein radius,
| although then the comparison to abundance matching results will
| require further assumptions.  However the authors deal with this, it
| needs to be at least mentioned and some estimate of the biases
| should be made.

We discuss this now in sec.2 2nd last paragraph and add a ref. to
2012MNRAS.424..104L that shows how to extrapolate to estimate full
virial mass.


| When doing the ensemble average of the mass models, how is the
| “mean” determined?  Is it on a tile-by-tile basis?  Is it by total
| lensing mass?  Is there some weighting of the different models based
| on quality of fit?  How are the uncertainties determined?  Figure 6
| shows the full range of mass, but how does this translate
| statistically into uncertainties on physical properties of the lens
| galaxy?

We take the common-sense approach of first computing any quantity of
interest (enclosed-mass curve, arrival-time surface) individually for
each mass map in an ensemble, and then considering the statistical
distribution of the derived quantity.  This is clarified in sect 4, par 1.
As this paper emphasises qualitative diagnostics, we have mostly just
presented ensemble averages (full ranges in the case of the mass maps).

An ensemble mean is tile-by-tile for a 2D mass map, but radius-wise
for enclosed mass.

There is no weighting within an ensemble.  (Weighting according to the
quality of the synthetic images is planned in future work.)


| Given the relatively small number of modelers and the fact that one
| lens was not modeled at all, there must be some lenses with just one
| model, or very few models.  How can you determine uncertainties on
| these models with so few numbers?  There must be some minimum number
| of models you need before you can start to get a handle on the model
| uncertainties.  I feel that either lenses below this minimum number
| should be excluded from the analysis from the time being, or a note
| should be made regarding the low number of models.  Perhaps adding a
| column to Table 1 showing the number of models would be useful.

For each lens, one model is chosen by consensus as the current best.

But note that "one model" contains a statistical ensemble of 200 mass
maps.  Uncertainties are derived from the ensemble.


| I thank the authors for providing a figure to justify their stellar
| mass accuracy claim.  I am at least partially reassured that the
| claim of 0.3 dex accuracy from the rest U-V color is not crazy,
| although I think it is still on the optimistic side.  I also think
| the text should include a few sentences about this test the authors
| performed to justify the claimed accuracy, and a forward reference
| to the Denzel et al. (in prep) project may be warranted.  However, I
| am not quite satisfied with the authors’ response to my other point
| about the stellar IMF, claiming that “redshift and photometric
| uncertainties are more important”.  Really?  The difference in M/L
| between a Chabrier and Salpeter IMF is nearly a factor of ~2
| (i.e.,~0.2-0.3 dex) and thus comparable, and although the text now
| mentions disagreements in the literature, it still does not justify
| the choice of Chabrier.  I would recommend the authors repeat this
| test using a Salpeter (or similar) IMF to see just how much the
| stellar mass changes, and adopt the difference between
| Salpeter/Chabrier as an additional uncertainty on top of the
| already-claimed 0.3 dex.

We apologize for not making this point clear. Indeed, the net effect
of a change of the IMF towards a bottom-heavy distribution (in evolved
populations) is to increase M/L without a fundamental change in
colours or line strengths (one of the reasons why these constraints
are so difficult to derive from observed data). So, a change from
Chabrier to Salpeter will indeed imply a ~0.3dex change in (log)
stellar mass, without a significant change in the photometric
observables.

What we meant is that the observations (mostly based on giant/dwarf
sensitive spectral features) suggest, at present, a departure from the
standard IMF only in the cores of the most massive early-type galaxies
(see, e.g. Figure 12 in La Barbera et al. 2016, MNRAS, 457, 1468).
Therefore, the net change in stellar M/L from a potential non-universality
may be rather subtle, and needlessly beyond the scope of this simple
approach on lensing galaxies.

We feel that a one-page portrait-oriented table (as currently) would
