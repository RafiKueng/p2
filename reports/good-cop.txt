| With the large numbers of gravitational lenses being discovered by
| current and future surveys, new strategies for finding and modeling
| these systems are needed to maximize the scientific output from these
| discoveries.  This paper builds on the unique SpaceWarps project and
| SpaghettiLens code to further develop a tool for citizen scientists to
| contribute to lens modeling efforts.  The importance of this work is
| clear and timely, and this paper warrants publication once some issues
| are addressed.
|
| My primary comments on this paper are that it is too light on details
| in some aspects, and often lacks a coherent flow and focus.  Further
| elaboration on some of the data and methods used will enhance the
| clarity and impact of this study.  and the paper could be
| better-organized into its various sections and subsections.  My
| comments on the paper are numbered and listed below, roughly in the
| order which they occur in the paper.

| Abstract: Typo: "Space Warpscitizen-science"

Now fixed.
 
| Sec. 1, 2nd paragraph: Arc-finders references should also include a
| recent arc-finder developed by Sonnenfeld et al. (2017).

Now cited.
 
| Sec. 1, 4th paragraph: Typo: "The result model" -> "The resulting
| model"

Now fixed.
 
| Sec. 1: The first time you mention "lensing mass", be sure to define
| it.  It is not clear whether it is referring to the mass within the
| Einstein radius determined from lens modeling, or whether it is a
| total mass that extrapolates from the lens model results.  This is a
| common confusion I had throughout the paper.

Now fixed.
(intro.tex:119; sec2:Third...)



| Sec. 1: When you start talking about the diagnostics, it seems that
| you have moved beyond the introduction and are now into the details of
| your work.  This would be better placed in a separate section, leaving
| Sec. 1 to background and motivation.

Now fixed.


| Sec. 1, 6th paragraph: This paragraph concludes with, "it is
| interesting to see what trends we can observe with the
| already-available data."  What are the trends that are observed?
| While the authors concede that interpretation of the results are
| tentative, there is little follow-up discussion about what you learned
| about the sample or the diagnostics themselves by tabulating these.
| How were these diagnostics decided upon and is it meant to be an
| exhaustive list, or do the authors anticipate developing more
| diagnostics in the future?  Are some diagnostics more useful than
| others?  This issue also applies more broadly to Sections 2 and 3 when
| the authors describe the diagnostics in more detail.

TODO: evaluate diagnostics in conclusion


| Sec. 2: I think a short section or subsection that summarizes the
| details of the imaging data would be helpful, e.g. depth, bands, area
| of the survey, etc.  Also, some details on the sample itself would
| help to better frame things: are the lens galaxies uniformly
| early-type galaxies?  What is the redshift/mass range and their
| uncertainties?  While some of these details are presented in Table 1
| and in previous papers, I feel that a brief summary in the text would
| make the entire paper more clear.

TODO: put in new sect. 2 with diagnostics


 
| Sec. 2, 5th paragraph: How is the size of the cutout shown to the
| viewer determined?  Since they are not uniform, doesn't this create a
| bias toward finding nearby galaxies for lenses where a larger cutout
| is shown?

TODO: explain zoom in.


 
| Sec. 2, last paragraph: It might be useful for the authors to relate
| their classifications (LQ/SQ/IQ) to the typical lensing configurations
| (cross/fold/cusp).

Explanations added (cross = CQ, fold -> IQ, cusp -> SQ or LQ).


| Sec. 3, 2nd paragraph: "…provided it is larger than to the lens
| redshift, we assumed all sources to lie at…" I don't think either "to"
| is needed here.

Typo fixed.
 
| Sec. 3, last sentence: "are the mass distributions plausible?"  This
| is a fairly abrupt ending to this section that I guess this is meant
| to lead into the next section where you check to see whether the
| lensing mass is consistent with the stellar mass and total mass, but
| that is not clear.  Evaluating the plausibility of the mass
| distribution seems to imply checks on things like the shape, profile
| slope, clumpiness, etc.  Some additional text connecting this sentence
| to the next section would be good.

TODO: do so.


| Sec. 4, first paragraph: I am skeptical of the claim that stellar
| masses can be estimated to within 0.3 dex from just a rest-frame U-V
| color, especially with just photometric redshifts.  The authors cite a
| single paper from 2008 to support this, but SPS modeling has advanced
| in recent years, and I would like to see them investigate other
| references to support this claim.  For example, Collett et al. (2013)
| claim that with photo-zs alone, stellar mass uncertainties are 0.45
| dex, and they use more than just a single color.

Ask Ignacio!!

 
| Sec. 4, 2nd/3rd paragraph: How are the final uncertainties on the
| stellar masses calculated?  It is stated that using the
| magnitude-stellar mass relation can have an error of "at most 1 dex",
| which seems like it should dominate the uncertainties shown in Figure
| 6.

TODO: add to sect on stellar masses

 
| Sec. 4, 3rd paragraph: Studies of early-type lens galaxies
| (e.g. SLACS; Auger et al. 2010) find that a Salpeter IMF is more
| consistent with observations.  Justify the use of a Chabrier IMF,
| and/or comment on these other studies and their effects on your
| results.

We have added a brief discussion of the current debates on the IMF,
with a reference to Smith et al 2015MNRAS.454L..71S -- which concisely
covers all the issues.  For the present sample, however, at this stage
redshift and photometric uncertainties are more important.

Incidentally, the present authors include representatives from studies
which disagree about stellar masses: Auger et al. 2009ApJ...705.1099A
Leier et al. 2016MNRAS.459.3677L

| Sec. 4, 3rd/4th paragraph and Figure 6: Figure 6 is plotting "lensing
| mass" vs.  "stellar mass", but the 4th paragraph of Sec. 4 says it is
| a comparison of "stellar and total masses".  Is this the stellar and
| total mass within the Einstein radius?  If so, how do you calculate
| the stellar mass within that radius?

TODO: No total, not encl in E_r, clarify!


| Sec. 5, 2nd paragraph: Typo: "The way mass models also needs to
| change"

Typo fixed.
 
| Sec. 5: Some of the details here, such as the 4th through 6th
| paragraphs, I think can be moved to the end of Sec. 4.  It seems more
| natural to discuss the results of the previous section within that
| section.  As currently constructed, Sec. 5 starts as a summary of the
| paper, then presents further analysis which was missing from the
| previous section, then goes back to summarizing the paper.

TODO: leave it there, but expand
The discussion of Figure 6 has been moved to the previous section.



| Table 1: Put uncertainties on the redshifts and stellar masses of the
| lenses.  Also, the stylized "X"s and checkmarks may be nice for
| someone reading the paper, but hopefully the machine-readable version
| will use ASCII characters that can be easily read in by a computer.

TODO: ascii
TODO: discuss uncertainties on redshifts in text.


| Table 1: While I understand that the primary goal is to show the
| diagnostics, why not also show the inferred lens model parameters such
| as r_E?  Perhaps the authors are saving those for a future paper, but
| this should at least be discussed somewhere in the text.  After all,
| the title of the paper is "Models of gravitational lens candidates"!

TODO: answer: because of not really a physical parameter, not that important in this case.


| Appendix: These details on the improvements to the SpaghettiLens code
| feel a bit out of place in this paper.  Do the authors plan a
| follow-up SpaghettiLens paper where these details might be more
| relevant?  If not, I suppose placing them in an Appendix of this paper
| is reasonable, it just seemed odd to me.

The latter is indeed the case -- we feel the improvements merit
presentation, but not a whole new paper, hence the Appendix.

| A2: How is the initial size of the mass tiles chosen?  From Figure 4,
| it seems to vary from lens to lens.

TODO: modeller chosen


| A3: Typo: "2.5 as"

Changed "as" -> "because".  We hope the sentence is clearer now.


| Figure A3 caption: Typos: "princible" -> "principal";
| "parametrisation" -> "parameterization"

Typos fixed.  We see that MNRAS uses parametrize/parametrization
and have changed all occurrences accordingly.


| Figure A3: The models always overestimate the true r_E, which was also
| noted in the 2015 SpaghettiLens paper.  Has the discrepancy improved
| at all due to the recent upgrades to the code?

The overestimates in r_E were a result of the too-shallow mass
profiles.  (This is now noted in the text of Appendix A2).  As the
Appendix discusses, sub-sampling the central region appears to the way
to cure the problem, but we do not have a completely satisfactory
implementation as yet.
