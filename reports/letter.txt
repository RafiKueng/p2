Scientific Editor's Comments:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that due to a bug in the analysis pipeline, models for two
candidates were not shown in the first version of table 1. Since then we
fixed this bug and added those back in for this version.
Also 3 incorrect mophologies were corrected.

(They were placed at the border of overlapping SpaceWarps tiles, and
thus their ASW ID was not unique. For example SW 48 can be seen on both
SpaceWarps tiles ASW000066w [bottom] and ASW00007ls [top]

Reviewer: 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we would like to express our gratitude to reviewer 2 for
her/his detailed and very helpful remarks!  We have revised our paper
accordingly and feel that her/his comments helped clarify and improve our
paper greatly.


| My primary comments on this paper are that it is too light on details
| in some aspects, and often lacks a coherent flow and focus.  Further
| elaboration on some of the data and methods used will enhance the
| clarity and impact of this study.  and the paper could be
| better-organized into its various sections and subsections.  My
| comments on the paper are numbered and listed below, roughly in the
| order which they occur in the paper.

| Abstract: Typo: "Space Warpscitizen-science"

Now fixed.

 
| Sec. 1, 2nd paragraph: Arc-finders references should also include a
| recent arc-finder developed by Sonnenfeld et al. (2017).

Now cited.

 
| Sec. 1, 4th paragraph: Typo: "The result model" -> "The resulting
| model"

Now fixed.
 

| Sec. 1: The first time you mention "lensing mass", be sure to define
| it.  It is not clear whether it is referring to the mass within the
| Einstein radius determined from lens modeling, or whether it is a
| total mass that extrapolates from the lens model results.  This is a
| common confusion I had throughout the paper.

It is a total mass.
Now clarified in (sec:The candidates and models; item:Thirdly...)


| Sec. 1: When you start talking about the diagnostics, it seems that
| you have moved beyond the introduction and are now into the details of
| your work.  This would be better placed in a separate section, leaving
| Sec. 1 to background and motivation.

We rearranged what were Sec 1 and 2 into three new parts.
Sec 1 covers the introductioary material only, whereas the new Sec. 2
covers the candidates, the models and the diagnostics.


| Sec. 1, 6th paragraph: This paragraph concludes with, "it is
| interesting to see what trends we can observe with the
| already-available data."  What are the trends that are observed?
| While the authors concede that interpretation of the results are
| tentative, there is little follow-up discussion about what you learned
| about the sample or the diagnostics themselves by tabulating these.
| How were these diagnostics decided upon and is it meant to be an
| exhaustive list, or do the authors anticipate developing more
| diagnostics in the future?  Are some diagnostics more useful than
| others?  This issue also applies more broadly to Sections 2 and 3 when
| the authors describe the diagnostics in more detail.

We added a paragraph discussion the criterias in the summary section
and added some remarks in the new Sec 2.


| Sec. 2: I think a short section or subsection that summarizes the
| details of the imaging data would be helpful, e.g. depth, bands, area
| of the survey, etc.  Also, some details on the sample itself would
| help to better frame things: are the lens galaxies uniformly
| early-type galaxies?  What is the redshift/mass range and their
| uncertainties?  While some of these details are presented in Table 1
| and in previous papers, I feel that a brief summary in the text would
| make the entire paper more clear.

We added a summary of the CFHT LS details and the SpaceWarps candidates
and put it at the beginning of the new sec 2 (The candidates and models).

 
| Sec. 2, 5th paragraph: How is the size of the cutout shown to the
| viewer determined?  Since they are not uniform, doesn't this create a
| bias toward finding nearby galaxies for lenses where a larger cutout
| is shown?

The cutouts are uniform, but the users can zoom in manually.
We explain in sec:3 "Image morphology" paragraph 2.

 
| Sec. 2, last paragraph: It might be useful for the authors to relate
| their classifications (LQ/SQ/IQ) to the typical lensing configurations
| (cross/fold/cusp).

We added explanations in the last Par. of what now is sec 3.
(cross = CQ, fold -> IQ, cusp -> SQ or LQ).


| Sec. 3, 2nd paragraph: "…provided it is larger than to the lens
| redshift, we assumed all sources to lie at…" I don't think either "to"
| is needed here.

Typo fixed.


| Sec. 3, last sentence: "are the mass distributions plausible?"  This
| is a fairly abrupt ending to this section that I guess this is meant
| to lead into the next section where you check to see whether the
| lensing mass is consistent with the stellar mass and total mass, but
| that is not clear.  Evaluating the plausibility of the mass
| distribution seems to imply checks on things like the shape, profile
| slope, clumpiness, etc.  Some additional text connecting this sentence
| to the next section would be good.

It was not meant to be a segway but was actually about the properties
of the mass map the reviewer listed. We expanded this into a paragraph
to make it clear.
(sec:4.Mass Models; last paragraph)


| Sec. 4, first paragraph: I am skeptical of the claim that stellar
| masses can be estimated to within 0.3 dex from just a rest-frame U-V
| color, especially with just photometric redshifts.  The authors cite a
| single paper from 2008 to support this, but SPS modeling has advanced
| in recent years, and I would like to see them investigate other
| references to support this claim.  For example, Collett et al. (2013)
| claim that with photo-zs alone, stellar mass uncertainties are 0.45
| dex, and they use more than just a single color.

[ Please find the refenced figure here:
  http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~rafik/data/p2/lMs.pdf ]

We would like to show the referee a figure to justify this
guesstimate. The attached figure shows the retrieval of the stellar
mass of a mock galaxy, created with a set of population synthesis
models following an exponential (tau) model at solar metallicity,
whose star formation starts at z=5 and with an exponential timescale
given by the parameter tau, as labelled in the figure.  We only use
the F606W-F814W photometry to constrain the stellar M/L(F814W)
following a standard Bayesian approach that explores a wide range of
ages and metallicities (see Ferreras et al. 2008 for details), and
adopts a 10% uncertainty in the photometry. The analysis follows a
MonteCarlo approach, and also includes a 10% error in the estimate of
the redshift, to mimic the effect of a photo-z derivation (this is a
conservative estimate; standard photo-z's tend to be at the 5% level
or better).

The left-hand panel shows the expected uncertainties (both statistical
and systematic) as a function of the timescale chosen for the mock
galaxy, which is considered to be at redshift z=0.5. This figure shows
the results obtained from two independent sets of models: BC03 are
Bruzual & Charlot 2003 models with STELIB stellar libraries, whereas
V12 are Vazdekis et al. 2012 models with MILES stellar libraries.  The
panel on the right fixes the timescale to 2Gyr and varies the redshift
(using BC03 models). Note the quoted 0.3dex estimate is rather
conservative. Moreover, the uncertainty on the redshift is not very
important, as long as it is kept at the 10% level as one would expect
with reasonable photo-z's. For instance, at z=0.5, a variation of
plus/minus 0.1 will shift the observed 5000A wavelength by about 200A,
significantly less than the FWHM of the broadband filters. However,
the passband shifting is important if we consider galaxies at
different redshifts if we keep on using the same colour (right hand
panel). As we move away from the 4000A break, the colour is less able
to constrain the population parameters, giving rise to a higher
uncertainty, as seen at the low- and high-z limits in the right-hand panel.

Incidentally, we note that the quote of 0.45dex in Collett et al. (2013)
is not backed by any estimate, derivation, or previous work, although we
understand it is a good educated guess.

Also note the work presented here is just a pilot study. In an ongoing
project (Denzel et al.)  we are including several broadband filters to
better constrain the stellar M/L


| Sec. 4, 2nd/3rd paragraph: How are the final uncertainties on the
| stellar masses calculated?  It is stated that using the
| magnitude-stellar mass relation can have an error of "at most 1 dex",
| which seems like it should dominate the uncertainties shown in Figure
| 6.

The uncertainties or maybe better "span" displayed are due to the differences
between the two age trends *only*.
We added few words to clarify this (in sec:4.Mass Models par.4 and fig:7)

 
| Sec. 4, 3rd paragraph: Studies of early-type lens galaxies
| (e.g. SLACS; Auger et al. 2010) find that a Salpeter IMF is more
| consistent with observations.  Justify the use of a Chabrier IMF,
| and/or comment on these other studies and their effects on your
| results.

We have added a brief discussion of the current debates on the IMF,
with a reference to Smith et al 2015MNRAS.454L..71S -- which concisely
covers all the issues.  For the present sample, however, at this stage
redshift and photometric uncertainties are more important.

Incidentally, the present authors include representatives from studies
which disagree about stellar masses: Auger et al. 2009ApJ...705.1099A
Leier et al. 2016MNRAS.459.3677L


| Sec. 4, 3rd/4th paragraph and Figure 6: Figure 6 is plotting "lensing
| mass" vs.  "stellar mass", but the 4th paragraph of Sec. 4 says it is
| a comparison of "stellar and total masses".  Is this the stellar and
| total mass within the Einstein radius?  If so, how do you calculate
| the stellar mass within that radius?

It is "total lensing mass". We replaced "total mass" with "lensing mass"
thoughout the text for clarification and define lensing mass in 
(sec:The candidates and models; item:Third ...)


| Sec. 5, 2nd paragraph: Typo: "The way mass models also needs to
| change"

Typo fixed.


| Sec. 5: Some of the details here, such as the 4th through 6th
| paragraphs, I think can be moved to the end of Sec. 4.  It seems more
| natural to discuss the results of the previous section within that
| section.  As currently constructed, Sec. 5 starts as a summary of the
| paper, then presents further analysis which was missing from the
| previous section, then goes back to summarizing the paper.

Some of the discussion of Figure 6 has been moved to the previous section.
The details of Fig 6 are now discussed in sec:5, the overall trend and
conclusions from that plot in (sec:6: Summary and conclusions).


| Table 1: Put uncertainties on the redshifts and stellar masses of the
| lenses.  Also, the stylized "X"s and checkmarks may be nice for
| someone reading the paper, but hopefully the machine-readable version
| will use ASCII characters that can be easily read in by a computer.

The requested values don't fit nicely onto the page in the printed version,
even a second line for the caption or adding a few more pixels in a row makes
the box overfull. So we decided to keep the current layout.

We added however an ascii / csv online supplement of table 1 with all the
additional data used to generate the halo matching index (m_moster), raw
values, errors and einstein radii.

Additionally we discuss the errors in (sec:5:Stellar.. par:4).
We added a statement that the lens properties are taken from the CFHTLS
photometric catalog (Coupon et al. 2009; 2009A&A...500..981C) and discuss
uncertainties of zlens in (sec:4:Mass models; par:2)


| Table 1: While I understand that the primary goal is to show the
| diagnostics, why not also show the inferred lens model parameters such
| as r_E?  Perhaps the authors are saving those for a future paper, but
| this should at least be discussed somewhere in the text.  After all,
| the title of the paper is "Models of gravitational lens candidates"!

We think that they are not really an important physical parameter and not
that interessting in this case. We added these values to the online
supllement of table 1 for the interessted reader.


| Appendix: These details on the improvements to the SpaghettiLens code
| feel a bit out of place in this paper.  Do the authors plan a
| follow-up SpaghettiLens paper where these details might be more
| relevant?  If not, I suppose placing them in an Appendix of this paper
| is reasonable, it just seemed odd to me.

The latter is indeed the case -- we feel the improvements merit
presentation, but not a whole new paper, hence the Appendix.


| A2: How is the initial size of the mass tiles chosen?  From Figure 4,
| it seems to vary from lens to lens.

The size of the mass maps and the "mass tile radius" are chosen by the
modeller. This is now explained in the first paragraph of the Mass-Models
section.


| A3: Typo: "2.5 as"

Changed "as" -> "because".  We hope the sentence is clearer now.


| Figure A3 caption: Typos: "princible" -> "principal";
| "parametrisation" -> "parameterization"

Typos fixed.  We see that MNRAS uses parametrize/parametrization
and have changed all occurrences accordingly.


| Figure A3: The models always overestimate the true r_E, which was also
| noted in the 2015 SpaghettiLens paper.  Has the discrepancy improved
| at all due to the recent upgrades to the code?

The overestimates in r_E were a result of the too-shallow mass
profiles.  (This is now noted in the text of Appendix A2).  As the
Appendix discusses, sub-sampling the central region appears to be the
way to cure the problem, but we do not have a completely satisfactory
implementation as yet.

Reviewer: 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| The paper discusses the usage of SpagettiLens on a sample of 59 lens
| candidates from Space Worps. This tool allows non-professional
| volunteers to produce tentative mass models of gravitationally
| lensing galaxies with the help of a graphical web interface within
| the context of Citizen-Science Projects. This is an attempt to face
| the growing number of lens candidates. Apart from the method which
| has already been published, the paper discusses the labels used to
| describe the appearance of the lenses/images, makes use of stellar
| mass estimates as a diagnostic and presents a tentative estimate of
| the mass profile of the 59 candidates.  In the two appendixes the
| authors briefly mention some improvement in the synthetic data used
| to train the volunteers and the fact that they introduced more
| degrees of freedom in the mass modelling by increasing the number of
| pixels in the central region.

The remark above "synthetic data used to train the volunteers" is
puzzling, as the paper mentions no such thing.  The word "synthetic"
appears only for synthetic images, which are introduced (in the
Mass-Models section) as follows:

   Figure 3 shows what we call synthetic images, meaning
   reconstructions of the extended lensed features by fitting for a
   source. These were generated by a new method, explained in
   Appendix A1

Was the reviewer perhaps thinking of training sets in machine learning?


| - The authors claim that this approach would allow the analysis of a
| large number of lens candidates. This is a crucial point for this
| paper but no indication, even tentative, of the time required to
| obtain a sufficiently reliable model is given.

The actual time needed in the future is hard to predict, since it greatly
depends on the number of volunteers and other factors.
We added a paragraph and a plot that elaborates about the time needed
to create the set presented here in beginning of (sec:2, par:2)


| - The mass mapping method published in Küng et al. (2015) has been
| slightly modified by using more pixels in the central region. This
| change is not substantial and is of dubious utility as discussed in
| the next point.

The smaller pixels in the central region are indeed a detail
(hence discussed in an Appendix) but they are not "dubious",
see below.


| - My major concern is about the mass models. The lens configuration
| shown in the images allows to quantify the mass within the Einstein
| radius only. It is therefore impossible to derive a radial profile
| as shown in figure 5.  The constraints are just insufficient to
| obtain a radial profile. The images of the sample are well
| reproduced by the models but this is only because of the large
| number of degrees of freedom involved in the modelling and the
| little constraints which are available. This rises serious doubts
| about the reliability of the models and their possible usage.

This point is essentially the well-known steepness degeneracy or
mass-sheet degeneracy.  The objection applies if a single mass model
is presented and claimed to be the correct mass map.  But that is not
what we do.

We work with statistical ensembles of what the mass map could be.
As noted in the Mass-Models section:

    a statistical ensemble of two-dimensional mass maps is
    returned. This ensemble, along with derived quantities and
    uncertainties, makes up one SpaghettiLens model.

The degeneracy is not broken, but it becomes "nuanced".  As the
mass-profile figures show, the enclosed mass is best constrained at
the notional Einstein radius, becoming more uncertain at smaller and
larger radii.

The technique is not perfect, but has extensively tested in the cited
papers by Coles et al. (2014) and Küng et al. (2015), as well as the
Appendix of the present paper.

Nor is the method controversial --- the first author of the original
lens-degeneracy paper (Falco, Gorenstein & Shapiro, 1985) is also
co-author on work using the present technique (Bruderer, Read, Coles,
Leier, Falco, Ferreras & Saha 2016MNRAS.456..870B).


| - A stellar mass and a lensing mass estimate, assuming the
| candidates to be real lenses, without any relevant interpretation or
| relevant conclusion is not enough. No significant scientific results
| are presented.  For these reasons the results so far presented are
| not sufficient to justify a publication on MNRAS.

In fact, the main science result (Figure 6), although presented
cautiously -- correctly so, given the current uncertainties -- is
very exciting.

We see that galaxies whose total mass is comparable to the Milky Way's
_stellar_ mass are very inefficient at forming stars (SN feedback?)
Star-formation becomes more efficient for masses a few times that, and
then cuts off again (AGN feedback?).  To see the whole range in a
single sample is, all caveats notwithstanding, indeed exciting.

We did expand the interpretation of Figure 6 to better hilight these points.
