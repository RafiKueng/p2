We have added (near the start of in Section 5) a short explanation for
how stellar masses could be effectively estimated from just rest-frame
U and V fluxes.  The added text is a qualitative summary of our
earlier more detailed response to the referee on this point.

The topic, though important, is somewhat tangential to the present
paper, which uses a cruder approximation with just one photometric band.
