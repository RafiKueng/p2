We have added (near the start of in Section 5) a few more words to
shortly elaborate.

We agree that the effect of a stellar IMF on the mass budget is
important.  We emphasize, however, that this paper presents a pilot
study with a simple estimate of stellar mass based on standard
population synthesis models. Our group is working on the stellar IMF
front, and the upgraded versions of the lensing analysis (Denzel et
al. in preparation) will take this issue into account.

Many thanks for your comments.
