Scientific Editor's Comments:

The first referee recommended rejection, for the reasons given in
the report.  The second is more lenient, but there are still major
concerns over how quickly a system might be modelled, the mass
models used, and the lack of clear new scientific results. Please
address these points in any revision.






| Assistant Editor Comments:
| 
| - Please present the abstract as a single paragraph. 

TODO


| * mass profile captions
| * mstel vs mlens axis labels
| * hires
| 
| - Please ensure that all textual labels in figures are at least as large as
| the caption text; any smaller and they become too difficult to read.
 
TODO


| - Please ensure that all references to arxiv papers also include the preprint 
| number, e.g. arXiv:1506.08817.

Now fixed.
