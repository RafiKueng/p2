| Reviewer 1:

| The paper discusses the usage of SpagettiLens on a sample of 59 lens
| candidates from Space Worps. This tool allows non-professional
| volunteers to produce tentative mass models of gravitationally
| lensing galaxies with the help of a graphical web interface within
| the context of Citizen-Science Projects. This is an attempt to face
| the growing number of lens candidates. Apart from the method which
| has already been published, the paper discusses the labels used to
| describe the appearance of the lenses/images, makes use of stellar
| mass estimates as a diagnostic and presents a tentative estimate of
| the mass profile of the 59 candidates.  In the two appendixes the
| authors briefly mention some improvement in the synthetic data used
| to train the volunteers and the fact that they introduced more
| degrees of freedom in the mass modelling by increasing the number of
| pixels in the central region.

There is nothing in the paper about

   "synthetic data used to train the volunteers"

In fact, in Section 3, we wrote

   Figure 3 shows what we call synthetic images, meaning
   reconstructions of the extended lensed features by fitting for a
   source. These were generated by a new method, explained in
   Appendix A1.

and of course the Appendix gives details.

It appears that the referee only skimmed the paper.

| - The authors claim that this approach would allow the analysis of a
| large number of lens candidates. This is a crucial point for this
| paper but no indication, even tentative, of the time required to
| obtain a sufficiently reliable model is given.

TODO: Talk about time.

| - The mass mapping method published in KÃ¼ng et al. (2015) has been
| slightly modified by using more pixels in the central region. This
| change is not substantial and is of dubious utility as discussed in
| the next point.

We agree that is a detail (hence discussed in an Appendix)
but it is far from "dubious", see below.

| - My major concern is about the mass models. The lens configuration
| shown in the images allows to quantify the mass within the Einstein
| radius only. It is therefore impossible to derive a radial profile
| as shown in figure 5.  The constraints are just insufficient to
| obtain a radial profile. The images of the sample are well
| reproduced by the models but this is only because of the large
| number of degrees of freedom involved in the modelling and the
| little constraints which are available. This rises serious doubts
| about the reliability of the models and their possible usage.

The referee's assertion is a well-known meme, derived from a classic
result by Falco, Gorenstein & Shapiro (1985) [nowadays called the
steepness degeneracy or mass-sheet degeneracy] which appears to imply
what the referee asserts.

However, lens modelling has progressed since 1985.  The modern view is
that the enclosed mass is best-constrained at the notional Einstein
radius, becoming more uncertain at smaller and larger radii.  Radial
profiles derived by the same basic method as in this paper have been
published without controversy.  Indeed E. Falco from the original 1985
result has co-authored such work (e.g. Bruderer et al 2016MNRAS.456..870B).

But even without knowing the literature, just see Figure A2.
If indeed it is "impossible to derive a radial profile", how come the
method is actually working?

Again, it appears that the referee only skimmed the paper.

| - A stellar mass and a lensing mass estimate, assuming the
| candidates to be real lenses, without any relevant interpretation or
| relevant conclusion is not enough. No significant scientific results
| are presented.  For these reasons the results so far presented are
| not sufficient to justify a publication on MNRAS.

TODO: Expand interpretation of Figure 6.
