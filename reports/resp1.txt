| Reviewer 1:

| The paper discusses the usage of SpagettiLens on a sample of 59 lens
| candidates from Space Worps. This tool allows non-professional
| volunteers to produce tentative mass models of gravitationally
| lensing galaxies with the help of a graphical web interface within
| the context of Citizen-Science Projects. This is an attempt to face
| the growing number of lens candidates. Apart from the method which
| has already been published, the paper discusses the labels used to
| describe the appearance of the lenses/images, makes use of stellar
| mass estimates as a diagnostic and presents a tentative estimate of
| the mass profile of the 59 candidates.  In the two appendixes the
| authors briefly mention some improvement in the synthetic data used
| to train the volunteers and the fact that they introduced more
| degrees of freedom in the mass modelling by increasing the number of
| pixels in the central region.

This summary is somewhat garbled.  The paper does not have

   "synthetic data used to train the volunteers"

We have synthetic images, which are concisely described (in Section 3)
as follows:

   Figure 3 shows what we call synthetic images, meaning
   reconstructions of the extended lensed features by fitting for a
   source. These were generated by a new method, explained in
   Appendix A1.

| - The authors claim that this approach would allow the analysis of a
| large number of lens candidates. This is a crucial point for this
| paper but no indication, even tentative, of the time required to
| obtain a sufficiently reliable model is given.

TODO: Talk about time.

| - The mass mapping method published in KÃ¼ng et al. (2015) has been
| slightly modified by using more pixels in the central region. This
| change is not substantial and is of dubious utility as discussed in
| the next point.

The smaller pixels in the central region are indeed a detail
(hence discussed in an Appendix) but they are not "dubious",
see below.

| - My major concern is about the mass models. The lens configuration
| shown in the images allows to quantify the mass within the Einstein
| radius only. It is therefore impossible to derive a radial profile
| as shown in figure 5.  The constraints are just insufficient to
| obtain a radial profile. The images of the sample are well
| reproduced by the models but this is only because of the large
| number of degrees of freedom involved in the modelling and the
| little constraints which are available. This rises serious doubts
| about the reliability of the models and their possible usage.

The referee points out (correctly) that free-form lens reconstruction
is an underdetermined inverse problem.  There are many degeneracies
known, in particular the steepness degeneracy or mass-sheet
degeneracy, which goes back to Falco, Gorenstein & Shapiro (1985).

The modern view is that the enclosed mass is best-constrained at the
notional Einstein radius, becoming more uncertain at smaller and
larger radii.  Radial profiles derived by the same basic method as in
this paper have been published without controversy.  Indeed E. Falco
from the original 1985 result has co-authored such work (e.g. Bruderer
et al 2016MNRAS.456..870B).

But even without knowing the literature, just see Figure A2.
If indeed it is "impossible to derive a radial profile", how come the
method is actually working?

Again, it appears that the referee only skimmed the paper.

| - A stellar mass and a lensing mass estimate, assuming the
| candidates to be real lenses, without any relevant interpretation or
| relevant conclusion is not enough. No significant scientific results
| are presented.  For these reasons the results so far presented are
| not sufficient to justify a publication on MNRAS.

TODO: Expand interpretation of Figure 6.
