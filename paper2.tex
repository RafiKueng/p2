\begin{abstract}
We report modelling follow-up of recently-discovered
gravitational-lens candidates in the CFHT Legacy Survey.  Lens
modelling was done by a small group of specially-interested volunteers
from the Space~Warps citizen-science community who originally found
the candidate lenses.  Models are categorised according to seven
qualitative and quantitive points.  Also included are some
improvements to the modelling software used (SpaghettiLens),
and discussion of strategies for scaling to future surveys
with more and frequent discoveries.

The candidates successfully modelled are all galaxies, with inferred
lensing masses ranging from $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to $>10^{13}M_\odot$.
Stellar masses have also been estimated, using photometry from the
CFHTLS pipeline and stellar-population models.  A trend well-known
in nearby galaxies, that star-formation efficiency is maximal for
total masses of $\approx10^{12}M_\odot$ and reduces for both lower and
higher masses, is discernable also in these much more distant
galaxies.
