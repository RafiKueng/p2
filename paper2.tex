\begin{abstract}
We report modelling follow-up of recently-discovered
gravitational-lens candidates in the CFHT Legacy Survey.  Lens
modelling was done by a small group of specially-interested volunteers
from the Space~Warps citizen-science community who originally found
the candidate lenses.  Models are categorised according to seven
qualitative and quantitive points.  Also included are some
improvements to the modelling software used (SpaghettiLens) are
presented, and discussion of strategies for scaling to future surveys
with more and frequent discoveries.

The candidates successfully modelled are all galaxies, with inferred
lensing masses ranging from $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to $>10^{13}M_\odot$.
Stellar masses have also been estimated, using photometry from the
CFHTLS pipeline and stellar-population models.  The trend well-known
in nearby galaxies, that star-formation efficiency is maximal for
total masses of $\approx10^{12}M_\odot$ and reduces for both lower and
higher masses, is discernable also in these much more distant
galaxies.

\section{Introduction}

A passing remark in the {\em Feynman Lectures}\footnote{
  \cite{1963flp..book.....F}} --- ``if you are looking for a good
problem, the exact details of how the arms are formed and what
determine the shapes of these galaxies has not been worked out'' ---
tells us that circa 1960, galaxy dynamics was expected be an easy
research puzzle, whose solution was just around the corner.  Yet a
half-century later, galaxies are not nearly as well-understood as
stars were then.  Two complications, which are clear now but were not
so clear then, are: (i)~dynamical chaos, because galaxies are not
spherical, and (ii)~dark matter.

The CFHTLS \citep{2012SPIE.8448E..0MC} has been a rich source of
lenses by arc-finders, by machine learning \citep{2016arXiv160504309P}
and by visual inspection \citep{2016MNRAS.455.1171M}.  The latter is
of particular interest here.

\section{Lens Modelling}


\subsection{Additional / Improved Synthetic Image}

Volunteers often ask about better indicators to identify wether the modelling resulted in a ``good'' or ``bad'' model.
We developped a prototype of a better syntetic image than just the rendering of a \todo{insert currently used source profile} profile.
It operates on the composite input image.
The user has to mask the supposed lensed images.
The algorith then establishes a grid on the source plane and projects the masked pixels of the lense plane back to the source plane.
Multiple lens plane pixels fall onto one source plane pixel and get averaged.
The new synthetic image then reverses the mapping, coloring each pixel in the lens plane with the corresponding values of the source plane pixel.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/new_synth_img_detailed}
  \caption{
      Top-left: Orginal image, top-right: improved synthetic image for candidate \sw{5} (\asw{7k4r}) and model \model{12402};
      bottom from left to right:
        reconstructed source in color,
        intensity (grayscale),
        count of lens plane pixels per source plane pixel,
        residual of orginal image to improved syntetic image in grayscale
    }
  \label{fig:synthimg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HiRes / Subsampling of central region}
In a previous paper \cite{2015MNRAS.447.2170K} we identified the problem of the tendency of the models to be too shallow.
We pinned down the problem to the central region and are confident to have it fixed with enabling sub pixel sampling in the central area.
The software allows for subsampling parameters of radius of pixels $r_\text{subs}$ and amount of subpixels per pixel $n_\text{subs}$.
\figref{subsampling} shows the results of different settings for $r_\text{subs}$ and $n_\text{subs}$.
We can see that even the computationally least expensive settings of $r_\text{subs}=1$ and $n_\text{subs}=3$ leads to drastically improved profiles.

    $\cdot \cdot \cdot / \cdot \cdot \cdot $: $r_\text{subs}=3$, $n_\text{subs}=3$.
    }
  \label{fig:subsampling}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameterisation of pixel models} \label{sec:parameter}
In order to fit the set of pixelated models to a single parameterised model, a program was written that took a parameterised function and subtracted from it the mean and the principle components of the data, which were calculated using classical Principle Component Analysis.
This created the residuals function.
The number of components defined as principle was varied to test how this affected the output, and it was found that using 5 principle components tended to give a reasonable approximation.
A masking function was added which selected only the data points that fell inside the image of the lens, and the principal components were clipped in order to keep the values inside the region of the ensemble of models.
Any value higher than the clip was set to be the clip value.
This was chosen to be 2.5 as, assuming that the data follows a Gaussian error distribution, almost all the values for the variance should lie between 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
Minimising the residuals function produces the set of parameters that fit the parameterised function to the original pixelated ensemble most closely.
A least squares fit was used to perform this minimisation.
The parameterised model function was obtained from the gravitational potential of an isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution \cite{2001astro.ph..2341K}.
This model is frequently used to describe gravitational lenses as it tends to fit well with observations.
The isothermal ellipsoid model outputs three useful parameters: the radius of the Einstein ring, the ellipticity of the model and the angle of the ellipticity from the vertical, giving the orientation of the galaxy.
By applying this model to simulated lenses for which the values of these parameters were already known, it was possible to gain an estimate of the projected accuracy of the results, before applying the model to the candidate lensing galaxies.

Each of Figures~\figref{SW05}--\figref{SW57} show six panels, as
follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item The upper left panel show a cutout of the Space~Warps image,
  marked up with a spaghetti diagram.

\item Middle left is a contour map of the arrival-time surface after
  modelling.

\item Lower left is synthetic image.
  Figures~\figref{SW05}--\figref{SW29} include source fitting.
  Figures~\figref{SW42}--\figref{SW57} uses a simple conical
  profile.

\item Upper right is a mass map.

\item Middle right shows a circularly averaged profile of
  $\kappa$.\todo{Fix distance factor in $\kappa$.}

\item Lower right shows stellar vs stellar mass.\todo{which population
  model?}  Abundance matching \citep{2010ApJ...710..903M}.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item Figures~\figref{SW28}--\figref{SW29} show the five most
  convincing lens candidates. SW28 shown in Figure~\figref{SW28} is
  modelled as an arc with three blended images plus a saddle-point
  closer to the galaxy.  SW05 shown in Figure~\figref{SW05} has four
  distinct images (two close to blending).  SW02, SW09 and SW29
  (Figures~\figref{SW02}--\figref{SW29}) have similar
  configurations, with a minimum furthest from the galaxy and three
  images blended into an arc.  All five would be massive ellipticals;
  SW05 is the most massive of all the candidates, with a galaxy-group
  scale mass.

\item Figure~\figref{SW42} shows a candidate that modelling indicates
  is doubtful.  The images appears to have a similar morphology to the
  last three mentioned.  The implied mass, however, is implausibly
  high.\todo{Check photometry of this candidate.}

\item Figures~\figref{SW58} and \figref{SW19} appear plausible lens
  candidates.  Their morphology is similar to SW28, but the
  saddle-point counterimage is not visible.  We consider these lenses
  plausible but less convincing.

\item Figures~\figref{SW36} and \figref{SW57} shows {\em unclear\/}
  cases where modelling failed.

\end{itemize}

\section{Summary of models}

Table~\ref{tab:models} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Image morphology.
\item Whether images unblended.
\end{enumerate}

Throu visual inspection of the most popular models generated for each candidate and data generated by those models we classified the candidates in four categories.
The data available is shown in \figref{SW58}.
\todo{better explain criterias?}
The following sections list all the models for all the categories, each with a short explanation of the reasons.
Additionally, selected models are presented in figures for demonstration.

\subsection{plausible}

The plausible candidates fail in one category, but are quite convincing in all the others.
One particular reason for a candidate to end up in this category is that is has extended arcs, what is hard to modell with the current version of the program.
Thats why we recomend them for a following up study, for example for taking spectras or other follow up obersatories and for other modelling programs for a try.


\subsection{unclear}

This categy contains the ones that are hard to say.
They might look like lenses visually, but the modelling failed or prediced additional images.


\subsection{convincing}

The candidates that looked the most promising and left little doubt about being lenses were grouped into the category ``convincing''.
In Figures \figref{SW02} to \figref{SW29} we show all the convincing candidates.
Following we list the parameters, obtained applying the technique described in section~\ref{sec:parameter}

\lenstitle{SW02 (ASW000619d)}
Nice arc with counter image;
additional mass at 12 o'clock doesn't seem to influence the image.
\params{1.04}{0.32}{-5.18}

\lenstitle{SW05 (ASW0007k4r)}
The model predicts very steep central mass profile, and thus a very high lensing mass;
looks otherwise very convincing.
\params{3.80}{0.15}{52.50}
  
\lenstitle{SW09 (ASW0002asp)}
\params{1.12}{0.00}{88.39}
  
\lenstitle{SW28 (ASW0007xrs)}
Faint, but clearly visible arc and counter image;
but model sfits nicely
\params{1.04}{0.33}{66.63}
 
\lenstitle{SW29 (ASW0008qsm)}
Faint close arc, but reconstruion works very well;
parameterisation of ellypticity fails.
\params{0.73}{0.00}{249.80}


\subsection{doubtful}

SW42


\subsection{missing}

Finally this category lists all the candidates, that miss redshift measurements of the lens and thus further analysis is difficult.

\lenstitle{SW03 (ASW0006mea)}
\lenstitle{SW14 (ASW0004xjk)}
\lenstitle{SW25 (ASW00007mq)}
\lenstitle{SW30 (ASW0002p8y)}
\lenstitle{SW37 (ASW00086xq)}
\lenstitle{SW39 (ASW0005qiz)}
\lenstitle{SW40 (ASW0008wmr)}
\lenstitle{SW48 (ASW0000g95)}
\lenstitle{SW49 (ASW00007ls)}
\lenstitle{SW50 (ASW00008a0)}
\lenstitle{SW55 (ASW0007t5y)}
\lenstitle{SW59 (ASW00085cp)}
