\section{Introduction}

Space Warps \citep{2016MNRAS.455.1171M} found lens candidates
\citep{2016MNRAS.455.1191M}.

Modelling method \citep{2015MNRAS.447.2170K}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Stellar mass}

\subsection{Parameterisation of pixel models} \label{sec:parameter}
In order to fit the set of pixelated models to a single parameterised model, a program was written that took a parameterised function and subtracted from it the mean and the principle components of the data, which were calculated using classical Principle Component Analysis.
This created the residuals function.
The number of components defined as principle was varied to test how this affected the output, and it was found that using 5 principle components tended to give a reasonable approximation.
A masking function was added which selected only the data points that fell inside the image of the lens, and the principal components were clipped in order to keep the values inside the region of the ensemble of models.
Any value higher than the clip was set to be the clip value.
This was chosen to be 2.5 as, assuming that the data follows a Gaussian error distribution, almost all the values for the variance should lie between 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
Minimising the residuals function produces the set of parameters that fit the parameterised function to the original pixelated ensemble most closely.
A least squares fit was used to perform this minimisation.


The parameterised model function was obtained from the gravitational potential of an isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution \cite{2001astro.ph..2341K}.
This model is frequently used to describe gravitational lenses as it tends to fit well with observations.
The isothermal ellipsoid model outputs three useful parameters: the radius of the Einstein ring, the ellipticity of the model and the angle of the ellipticity from the vertical, giving the orientation of the galaxy.
By applying this model to simulated lenses for which the values of these parameters were already known, it was possible to gain an estimate of the projected accuracy of the results, before applying the model to the candidate lensing galaxies.


\subsection{Additional / Improved Synthetic Image}

Volunteers often ask about better indicators to identify wether the modelling resulted in a ``good'' or ``bad'' model.
We developped a prototype of a better syntetic image than just the rendering of a \todo{insert currently used source profile} profile.
It operates on the composite input image.
The user has to mask the supposed lensed images.
The algorith then establishes a grid on the source plane and projects the masked pixels of the lense plane back to the source plane.
Multiple lens plane pixels fall onto one source plane pixel and get averaged.
The new synthetic image then reverses the mapping, coloring each pixel in the lens plane with the corresponding values of the source plane pixel.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/new_synth_img_detailed}
  \caption{

        reconstructed source in color,
        intensity (grayscale),
        count of lens plane pixels per source plane pixel,
        residual of orginal image to improved syntetic image in grayscale
    }
  \label{fig:synthimg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HiRes / Subsampling of central region}
In a previous paper \cite{2015MNRAS.447.2170K} we identified the problem of the tendency of the models to be too shallow.
We pinned down the problem to the central region and are confident to have it fixed with enabling sub pixel sampling in the central area.
The software allows for subsampling parameters of radius of pixels $r_\text{subs}$ and amount of subpixels per pixel $n_\text{subs}$.
\Figref{subsampling} shows the results of different settings for $r_\text{subs}$ and $n_\text{subs}$.
We can see that even the computationally least expensive settings of $r_\text{subs}=1$ and $n_\text{subs}=3$ leads to drastically improved profiles.

\section{Summary of models}

Throu visual inspection of the most popular models generated for each candidate and data generated by those models we classified the candidates in four categories.
The data available is shown in \figref{SW58}.
\todo{better explain criterias?}
The following sections list all the models for all the categories, each with a short explanation of the reasons.
Additionally, selected models are presented in figures for demonstration.

\subsection{plausible}

The plausible candidates fail in one category, but are quite convincing in all the others.
One particular reason for a candidate to end up in this category is that is has extended arcs, what is hard to modell with the current version of the program.
Thats why we recomend them for a following up study, for example for taking spectras or other follow up obersatories and for other modelling programs for a try.

\subsection{convincing}

The canidates that looked the most promising and left little doubt about being lenses were grouped into the category ``convincing''.
In Figures \ref{fig:SW02} to \ref{fig:SW29} we show all the convincing candidates.
Following we list the parameters, obtained applying the technique described in section~\ref{sec:parameter}

\lenstitle{SW02 (ASW000619d)}
Nice arc with counter image;
additional mass at 12 o'clock doesn't seem to influence the image.
\params{1.04}{0.32}{-5.18}

\lenstitle{SW05 (ASW0007k4r)}
The model predicts very steep central mass profile, and thus a very high lensing mass;
looks otherwise very convincing.
\params{3.80}{0.15}{52.50}
  
\lenstitle{SW09 (ASW0002asp)}
\params{1.12}{0.00}{88.39}
  
\lenstitle{SW28 (ASW0007xrs)}

but model sfits nicely
\params{1.04}{0.33}{66.63}
 
\lenstitle{SW29 (ASW0008qsm)}
Faint close arc, but reconstruion works very well;
parameterisation of ellypticity fails.
\params{0.73}{0.00}{249.80}


\subsection{doubtful}

  faint white images, rather substuctre of ``lens'' ??
  
\lenstitle{SW22 (ASW0009ab8)} 
  very faint images, group configuration;
  model predicts additional images;
  mass ration close to unity
  
\lenstitle{SW23 (ASW0003r61)} 
  (no img)
  
\lenstitle{SW26 (ASW0005ma2)} 
  similar to SW10
  
\lenstitle{SW34 (ASW00051ld)} 
  (no img)
  
\lenstitle{SW41 (ASW0008xbu)} 
  similar to SW10. very ellyptical lens
  
\lenstitle{SW42 (ASW00096rm)} 
  ring like structure, but very strange distribution;
  model not too bad, brightnesses off;
  stellar mass way too lower
  
\lenstitle{SW53 (ASW00070vl)} 
  images don't look liked lensed;
  model predicts additional images
  



\begin{figure}
  \inclfig{SW42}{ASW00096rm_4Q3YCEWGLN}
  \caption{outlier because very odd mass ratio}
  \label{fig:SW42}
\end{figure}







\subsection{missing}

Finally this category lists all the candidates, that miss redshift measurements of the lens and thus further analysis is difficult.

\lenstitle{SW03 (ASW0006mea)}

\lenstitle{SW14 (ASW0004xjk)}

\lenstitle{SW25 (ASW00007mq)}

\lenstitle{SW30 (ASW0002p8y)}

\lenstitle{SW37 (ASW00086xq)}
