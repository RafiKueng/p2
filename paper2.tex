\begin{abstract}
We report modelling follow-up of recently-discovered
gravitational-lens candidates in the CFHT Legacy Survey.  Lens
modelling was done by a small group of specially-interested volunteers
from the Space~Warps citizen-science community who originally found
the candidate lenses.  Models are categorised according to seven
qualitative and quantitive points.  Also included are some
improvements to the modelling software used (SpaghettiLens),
and discussion of strategies for scaling to future surveys
with more and frequent discoveries.

The candidates successfully modelled are all galaxies, with inferred
lensing masses ranging from $\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ to $>10^{13}M_\odot$.
Stellar masses have also been estimated, using photometry from the
CFHTLS pipeline and stellar-population models.  A trend well-known
in nearby galaxies, that star-formation efficiency is maximal for
total masses of $\approx10^{12}M_\odot$ and reduces for both lower and
higher masses, is discernable also in these much more distant
galaxies.

\section{Introduction}

Light deflection at the rim of the Sun is famously $1.75''$.  The
deflection angle can also be expressed in terms of the escape velocity
$2v_{\rm esc}^2/c^2$, with $v_{\rm esc}$ at the solar surface being
$\simeq620\rm\,km/s$.  The Galactic escape velocity at the Sun's
location is similar: $\approx500\rm\,km/s$, typical of massive
galaxies.  Thus, the outer regions of massive galaxies have lensing
deflections comparable to that at the rim of the Sun.  Yet these
quantitatively similar deflections have qualitatively different
consequences.  Light deflection by the Sun must be accounted for in
modern astrometry \citep[see e.g.,][]{2015CQGra..32p5008C} but is not
itself a physics probe in the way it was a century ago.  With distant
galaxies, however, light bending by $\sim1''$ introduces two new
phenomena.  First, for galaxies distant enough that their apparent
size is comparable to the bending angle, light deflection can cause
multiple images of background sources, or strong lensing.  Second, the
gravitational field is dominated by dark matter, hence strong lensing
becomes a probe of dark matter in galaxies.

With no unambiguous dark-matter particle detections so far, dark
matter has studied only through its indirect consequences on galactic
and larger scales.  In most work, dark matter is taken to be a
collisionless non-relativistic fluid (cold dark matter or CDM); in
recent years, the simulation by \cite{2005Natur.435..629S} has been
particularly influential in studying the formation of CDM structures.
Other scenarios have also been considered, such as a cold condensing
boson fluid \citep{2016ApJ...818...89S}.  There is a general
consensus, however, that the origins of galaxy lie in the
gravitational collapse, fragmentation, and mergers of dark-matter
clumps, into which fell gas, cooling through radiative processes to
form dense clouds and eventually stars.  There is, however, much
debate about the details, of which \cite{2012RAA....12..917S} provide
a nice summary.

Strong-lensing galaxies are a useful source of information on the
mutual dynamics and dark matter and gas in galaxies.  The topic has
been explored in several studies
\citep{2009ApJ...703L..51K,2011ApJ...740...97L,2012MNRAS.424..104L,
  2016MNRAS.459.3677L,2016MNRAS.456..870B} but it is desirable to
enlarge the samples from tens of lensing galaxies to thousands.  Doing
so requires finding more lenses, of course, but also modelling their
masses.

Recent searches through the CFHTLS \citep{2012SPIE.8448E..0MC} using
arc-finders
\citep{2012ApJ...749...38M,2014A&A...567A.111M,2014ApJ...785..144G} by
machine learning \citep{2016arXiv160504309P} and by visual inspection
by a citizen-science volunteers
\citep[Space~Warps][]{2016MNRAS.455.1191M} have between them
discovered an average of four lenses per square degree.  So one can be
optimistic about finding many thousands of lenses in the next
generation of wide-field surveys.  The expected flood of new lens
discoveries will need a similarly huge modelling modelling effort to
reconstruct their mass distributions.  To prepare for the challenge of
massive-sample lens modelling, \cite{2015MNRAS.447.2170K} developed a
new modelling strategy, implemented as the SpaghettiLens system.  The
idea is to collaborate with experienced members of the citizen-science
community, who have already participated in lens discovery through
Space~Warps, as well as several other projects involving astronomical
data.  In this paper, we present SpaghettiLens models of
lens-candidates discovered through Space~Warps.

While SpaghettiLens is citizen science and based on Space~Warps, the
collaboration with volunteers takes a very different form.  In
Space~Warps, volunteers in a crowd of $\gtrsim10^4$ make independent
contributions.  Each person is presented with a random selection of
survey-patches and invited to (in effect) vote on each.  The system
estimates each volunteer's skill level according to test-patches
interspersed with the real data, and weights their votes accordingly
\citep{2016MNRAS.455.1171M}.  There is an active forum for volunteers,
but since everyone is seeing different data samples with minimal
overlap, the forum has little if any influence on votes.  With
SpaghettiLens there is a small group of volunteers and their
contributions are interdependent.\footnote{See ``Collaborative
  gravitational lens modelling\dots'' in {\tt
    http://letters.zooniverse.org} especially the model tree.}

Section~\ref{sec:spl} summarises the basics of the SpaghettiLens
system and discusses its ongoing development.  Basically, the system
delivers free-form reconstructions (with uncertainties) of the
sky-projected mass distributions of lens candidates.  These represent
a consensus among modelling volunteers as to the best that could be
achieved with the available data and software.  Photometric lens
redshifts are used; source redshifts are set to $z=2$.  The models
can, however, be trivially rescaled to use better redshift values, as
and when they become available.

Section~\ref{sec:stellar-mass} is about stellar mass.

Section~\ref{sec:examples} discusses ten systems in detail.

Section~\ref{sec:summary} has a summary table.


\section{Lens Modelling}\label{sec:spl}

\cite{2015MNRAS.447.2170K} introduced and implemented two
main ideas. One is a `spaghetti diagram,' which is a cartoon-like
markup of a candidate lensing system which encodes a proposal for its
mass distribution.  It enables volunteers to interact with a
server-side numerical engine \citep[GLASS, developed
  by][]{2014MNRAS.445.2181C} in an intuitive way.  The other new idea
was a `model tree' --- a volunteer can model a lens from scratch, or
they can modify an existing model and thus try to improve upon it.
This facility, in conjunction with forum discussion, enables
development trees of models.  The models reported in this paper are
the most recent ones for each lens candidate, but typically they are
descended from previous models through the contributions of more than
one individual.

\subsection{Additional / Improved Synthetic Image}

Volunteers often ask about better indicators to identify wether the modelling resulted in a ``good'' or ``bad'' model.
We developped a prototype of a better syntetic image than just the rendering of a \todo{insert currently used source profile} profile.
It operates on the composite input image.
The user has to mask the supposed lensed images.
The algorith then establishes a grid on the source plane and projects the masked pixels of the lense plane back to the source plane.
Multiple lens plane pixels fall onto one source plane pixel and get averaged.
The new synthetic image then reverses the mapping, coloring each pixel in the lens plane with the corresponding values of the source plane pixel.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/new_synth_img_detailed}
  \caption{
      Top-left: Orginal image, top-right: improved synthetic image for candidate \sw{5} (\asw{7k4r}) and model \model{12402};
      bottom from left to right:
        reconstructed source in color,
        intensity (grayscale),
        count of lens plane pixels per source plane pixel,
        residual of orginal image to improved syntetic image in grayscale
    }
  \label{fig:synthimg}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HiRes / Subsampling of central region}
In a previous paper \cite{2015MNRAS.447.2170K} we identified the problem of the tendency of the models to be too shallow.
We pinned down the problem to the central region and are confident to have it fixed with enabling sub pixel sampling in the central area.
The software allows for subsampling parameters of radius of pixels $r_\text{subs}$ and amount of subpixels per pixel $n_\text{subs}$.
Figure~\figref{subsampling} shows the results of different settings for $r_\text{subs}$ and $n_\text{subs}$.
We can see that even the computationally least expensive settings of $r_\text{subs}=1$ and $n_\text{subs}=3$ leads to drastically improved profiles.

\begin{figure}

    $\cdot \cdot \cdot / \cdot \cdot \cdot $: $r_\text{subs}=3$, $n_\text{subs}=3$.
    }
  \label{fig:subsampling}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameterisation of pixel models} \label{sec:parameter}
\todo{}
In order to fit the set of pixelated models to a single parameterised model, a program was written that took a parameterised function and subtracted from it the mean and the principle components of the data, which were calculated using classical Principle Component Analysis.
This created the residuals function.
The number of components defined as principle was varied to test how this affected the output, and it was found that using 5 principle components tended to give a reasonable approximation.
A masking function was added which selected only the data points that fell inside the image of the lens, and the principal components were clipped in order to keep the values inside the region of the ensemble of models.
Any value higher than the clip was set to be the clip value.
This was chosen to be 2.5 as, assuming that the data follows a Gaussian error distribution, almost all the values for the variance should lie between 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
Minimising the residuals function produces the set of parameters that fit the parameterised function to the original pixelated ensemble most closely.
A least squares fit was used to perform this minimisation.
The parameterised model function was obtained from the gravitational potential of an isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution \cite{2001astro.ph..2341K}.
This model is frequently used to describe gravitational lenses as it tends to fit well with observations.
The isothermal ellipsoid model outputs three useful parameters: the radius of the Einstein ring, the ellipticity of the model and the angle of the ellipticity from the vertical, giving the orientation of the galaxy.
By applying this model to simulated lenses for which the values of these parameters were already known, it was possible to gain an estimate of the projected accuracy of the results, before applying the model to the candidate lensing galaxies.

\section{Stellar mass}\label{sec:stellar-mass}

Based on \cite{2003MNRAS.344.1000B} models.\todo{Needs text.}

Following \cite{2010ApJ...710..903M}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\Mstel}{\Mhalo} &= \frac{2C_0}{(\Mhalo/M_1)^{-\beta} +
                                     (\Mhalo/M_1)^\gamma} \\
C_0 &= 0.02820, \quad M_1 = 10^{11.884} M_\odot \\
\beta &= 1.057, \quad \gamma = 0.556.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\haloindex = \frac{\ln(M/\Mstel)}{\ln(\Mhalo/\Mstel)}
\end{equation}
which we may call the halo-matching index.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\haloindex < 0$ is unphysical because $M<\Mstel$.
\item $\haloindex = 0$ is when the stellar mass exactly accounts for the
  lensing mass.
\item $0 < \haloindex < 1$ is the typical situation, where the lens
  includes stars and dark matter, but not the full halo.
\item $\haloindex = 1$ means that the lens consists of the entire halo.
\item $\haloindex > 1$ is in tension with abundance-matching, because the
  lensing mass exceeds the expected halo mass.
\end{itemize}


\section{Example systems}\label{sec:examples}

In this section we show modelling results for ten of the lens
candidates.  The first five (see Figures~\figref{SW05}--\figref{SW29})
are the most convincingly modelled systems.  The next three cases
(Figures~\figref{SW42},\figref{SW58}) are less good but still very
plausible models, and are representative of the majority of the
sample.  The last two are examples where the models were unconvincing
(Figures~\figref{SW36}) or completely failed (\figref{SW57}).

  \caption{Model results for SW57 (J143631.5+571131).}
  \label{fig:SW57}
\end{figure}

Let us first consider Figure~\figref{SW05}, which shows model results
from SW05 (J143454.4+522850).

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the upper row we have first a cutout of the Space~Warps
  image, marked up with a spaghetti diagram.  There are four distinct
  lensed images, and the spaghetti diagram proposes that they are a
  minimum nearest to the lensing galaxy, a close minimum-saddle pair,
  and a minimum further away. In Table~\ref{tab:models} we refer to
  such configurations as `$1+2+1$'.
\item Alongside is a synthetic image produced by modelling.  In it,
  the fitted lensed images are shown in colour, while the lensing
  galaxy and extraneous objects have been reduced to grayscale.  These
  two panels are qualitative and display no units, and moreover, the
  mutual alignment of the two panels is only approximate.
\item The middle row shows contour maps from the model.  At middle
  left, we have the arrival-time surface.
\item At middle right we have the mass distribution in the usual
  dimensionless form $\kappa$.  Again, these two panels are mainly
  qualitative: both panels are spatially registered and centred on the
  density-peak of the lens, but no scales have been included.
\item The base row supplies spatial and mass scales.  The left panel
  shows the circularly-averaged $\kappa$ of the model ensemble, with
  increasing radius (in arcsec).  The four short vertical lines
  correspond to the minima and saddle points marked in the upper-left
  panel.  The effective Einstein radius is also shown.  As the radius
  scale indicates SW05 is comparatively large lens on the
  sky.\todo{Fix distance factor in $\kappa$.}
\item Lower right shows the total mass in the model against the
  estimated stellar mass, alongside the values for the whole sample.
  The lower-right shaded region is unphysical according to the
  stellar-population models, because it gives $M<\Mstel$. The
  upper-left shaded region is unphysical according to abundance
  matching, because it gives $M>\Mhalo$.  That is to say, the unshaded
  region is $0<\haloindex<1$.
\end{enumerate}

Proceeding to Figure~\figref{SW28}, we have one image close to the
galaxy and an arc further away, which is interpreted as a blend of
three images (a saddle point with two minima on either side).  We call
this a '1+3' configuration.  It is an indication of a mass
distribution elongated along the arc-counterimage direction (along EW
in this case).

In Figures~\figref{SW02}--\figref{SW29} we see three candidates with
an arc close the lensing galaxy and one image further away.  The arc
is interpreted three images (a minimum with two saddle points on
either side).  We call this a '3+1' configuration.  It is an
indication of a mass distribution elongated perpendicular to the
arc-counterimage direction.

Figures~\figref{SW02}--\figref{SW29} (SW05, SW28, SW02, SW09 and SW29)
all correspond to the mass range of massive ellipticals.  SW05 is the
most massive of all the candidates, with a galaxy-group scale mass.

Figure~\figref{SW42} shows SW42.  The image morphology is similar to
SW05 in Figure~\figref{SW05}, but the lens is much smaller on the sky,
and the inferred mass is at the low end of the sample.  (The synthetic
image shown is cruder than for the five previous figures, but that
does not influence the mass models.)  If these preliminary findings
are confirmed by follow-up observations, this could be the most
dark-matter dominated lens known.\todo{Check photometry of this
  candidate.}

Figures~\figref{SW58} and \figref{SW19} appear plausible lens
candidates.  Their morphology is similar to SW28, but the saddle-point
counterimage is not visible.  We consider these lenses plausible but
less convincing.

Figures~\figref{SW36} and \figref{SW57} are cases where modelling
failed.


\section{Summary of models}\label{sec:summary}

Table~\ref{tab:models} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The image morphology concisely described: D for double, and
  quads in sub-categorised in four ways
  \citep[cf.][]{2003AJ....125.2769S} as LQ for long-axis quads (as in
  Figure~\figref{SW28}), SQ for short-axis quads (as in
  Figure~\figref{SW02}, \figref{SW09}, \figref{SW29}, \figref{SW42}),
  IQ for inclined quads (as in Figure~\figref{SW05}) and CQ for very
  symmetric core quads.
\item Whether the images are unblended.  Distinct unblended images (as
  in Figures~\figref{SW05} and \figref{SW42}) are an advantage in
  modelling, but not essential.
\item Whether all images are discernable.  The topography of an
  arrival-time surface, as encoded by a spaghetti diagram, may require
  more images than are visible.  For example, in Figure~\figref{SW58},
  the modeller has put in a conjectural saddle point near the lensing
  galaxy.
\item Whether the lens is fairly isolated.
\item Whether the arrival-time surface and synthetic image are
  plausible.  In Figure~\figref{SW36} the model implies extra images
  or a long arc, which are not seen.
\item Whether the mass map is reasonable.
\item The halo index $\haloindex$.
