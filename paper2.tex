\section{Introduction}



\section{Methods}

\subsection{Parameterisation of pixel models}
In order to fit the set of pixelated models to a single parameterised model, a program was written that took a parameterised function and subtracted from it the mean and the principle components of the data, which were calculated using classical Principle Component Analysis.
This created the residuals function.
The number of components defined as principle was varied to test how this affected the output, and it was found that using 5 principle components tended to give a reasonable approximation.
A masking function was added which selected only the data points that fell inside the image of the lens, and the principal components were clipped in order to keep the values inside the region of the ensemble of models.
Any value higher than the clip was set to be the clip value.
This was chosen to be 2.5 as, assuming that the data follows a Gaussian error distribution, almost all the values for the variance should lie between 2 and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
Minimising the residuals function produces the set of parameters that fit the parameterised function to the original pixelated ensemble most closely.
A least squares fit was used to perform this minimisation.


The parameterised model function was obtained from the gravitational potential of an isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution (Keeton, 2002).
This model is frequently used to describe gravitational lenses as it tends to fit well with observations.
The isothermal ellipsoid model outputs three useful parameters: the radius of the Einstein ring, the ellipticity of the model and the angle of the ellipticity from the vertical, giving the orientation of the galaxy.
By applying this model to simulated lenses for which the values of these parameters were already known, it was possible to gain an estimate of the projected accuracy of the results, before applying the model to the candidate lensing galaxies.

\section{Results}
We came up with four kind of candidates.

\subsection{HiRes image}
Almost certain candidates, that qualify for follow up hires observations



\subsection{Spectra}
Candidates to follow up with a spectral analysis. 


\subsection{Bad models}
Candidates that need more work to be modelled.
Or that have features that are hard / impossible to model with the current SpaghettiLens version.
Examples are group lenses



\subsection{Non Lenses}
Those are most probly non lenses, 



\subsection{plausible}

% 
% \section{Introduction}
% 
% This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
% See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
% for a full user guide.
% 
% All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
% in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
% and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.
% 
% \section{Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.}
% 
% Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
% It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.
% 
% \subsection{Maths}
% \label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere
% 
% Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
% or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
% as a numbered equation:
% 
% \begin{equation}
%     x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
% 	\label{eq:quadratic}
% \end{equation}
% 
% Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).
% 
% \subsection{Figures and tables}
% 
% Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
% worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.
% 
% Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
% e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.
% 
% % Example figure
% \begin{figure}
% 	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
% 	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
% 	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
% 	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
%     \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
% 	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
% 	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
%     \label{fig:example_figure}
% \end{figure}
% 
% % Example table
% \begin{table}
% 	\centering
% 	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
% 	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
% 	\label{tab:example_table}

% 	\end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% 
% 
% \section{Conclusions}
% 
% The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
% the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.
% 
% \section*{Acknowledgements}
