| Scientific Editor's Comments:
| 
| The first referee recommended rejection, for the reasons given in
| the report.  The second is more lenient, but there are still major
| concerns over how quickly a system might be modelled, the mass
| models used, and the lack of clear new scientific results. Please
| address these points in any revision.

The detailed comments from Reviewer 2 were very helpful in improving
the paper.

The comments by Reviewer 1 contain a number of errors, which we
enumerate below.

| Reviewer's Comments:
|
| Reviewer 1:

| The paper discusses the usage of SpagettiLens on a sample of 59 lens
| candidates from Space Worps. This tool allows non-professional
| volunteers to produce tentative mass models of gravitationally
| lensing galaxies with the help of a graphical web interface within
| the context of Citizen-Science Projects. This is an attempt to face
| the growing number of lens candidates. Apart from the method which
| has already been published, the paper discusses the labels used to
| describe the appearance of the lenses/images, makes use of stellar
| mass estimates as a diagnostic and presents a tentative estimate of
| the mass profile of the 59 candidates.

Actually only the online supplement (not mentioned by the referee)
presents mass profiles for all the candidates --- only nine are
included in the paper itself.

We mention this error, as the referee's "major concern" is about this
point.

| In the two appendixes the authors briefly mention some improvement
| in the synthetic data used to train the volunteers and the fact that
| they introduced more degrees of freedom in the mass modelling by
| increasing the number of pixels in the central region.

Reviewer Error no. 2: There is nothing in the paper about any
"synthetic data used to train the volunteers".  Appendix A1 is
about synthetic images of the modelled systems -- not synthetic data,
and nothing to do with training anyone.

| - The authors claim that this approach would allow the analysis of a
| large number of lens candidates. This is a crucial point for this
| paper but no indication, even tentative, of the time required to
| obtain a sufficiently reliable model is given.

| - The mass mapping method published in KÃ¼ng et al. (2015) has been slightly 
| modified by using more pixels in the central region. This change is not 
| substantial and is of dubious utility as discussed in the next point.

It is indeed a detail, and hence relegated to one section of the Appendix.
The "dubious" remark is based on a misconception.

| - My major concern is about the mass models. The lens configuration
| shown in the images allows to quantify the mass within the Einstein
| radius only. It is therefore impossible to derive a radial profile
| as shown in figure 5.



| The constraints are just insufficient to obtain a radial
| profile. The images of the sample are well reproduced by the models
| but this is only because of the large number of degrees of freedom
| involved in the modelling and the little constraints which are
| available. This rises serious doubts about the reliability of the
| models and their possible usage.


| - A stellar mass and a lensing mass estimate, assuming the candidates to be real 
| lenses, without any relevant interpretation or relevant conclusion is not 
| enough. No significant scientific results are presented.
| 
| For these reasons the results so far presented are not sufficient to justify a 
| publication on MNRAS.
