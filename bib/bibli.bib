	through the simultaneous reconstruction of 11 time delay lenses.
	The result is H-10=13.7+1.8-1.0 Gyr (H0=71+6-8 km s-1 Mpc-1).},

	follow-up imaging is available for a subset of 10 systems. We construct
	gravitational lens models and infer total enclosed mass, elongation,

	observed distribution of light we infer that there is a substantial
	amount of external shear with mean value langγextrang = 0.12 ± 0.05,

  abstract = {Foldit is a multiplayer online game in which players collaborate and
	compete to create accurate protein structure models. For specific
	hard problems, Foldit player solutions can in some cases outperform
	state-of-the-art computational methods. However, very little is known
	about how collaborative gameplay produces these results and whether
	Foldit player strategies can be formalized and structured so that
	they can be used by computers. To determine whether high performing
	player strategies could be collectively codified, we augmented the
	Foldit gameplay mechanics with tools for players to encode their
	folding strategies as “recipes” and to share their recipes with other
	players, who are able to further modify and redistribute them. Here
	we describe the rapid social evolution of player-developed folding
	algorithms that took place in the year following the introduction
	of these tools. Players developed over 5,400 different recipes, both
	by creating new algorithms and by modifying and recombining successful
	recipes developed by other players. The most successful recipes rapidly
	spread through the Foldit player population, and two of the recipes
	became particularly dominant. Examination of the algorithms encoded
	in these two recipes revealed a striking similarity to an unpublished
	algorithm developed by scientists over the same period. Benchmark
	calculations show that the new algorithm independently discovered
	by scientists and by Foldit players outperforms previously published
	methods. Thus, online scientific game frameworks have the potential
	not only to solve hard scientific problems, but also to discover
	and formalize effective new strategies and algorithms.}

	means that some models for one lens can be ruled out by data on a
	different lens. We explain using two worked examples. One example
	models 1115+080 and 1608+656 (time-delay quadruple systems) and 1933+503
	(a prospective time-delay system) all together, yielding time-delay
	predictions for the third lens and a 90% confidence estimate of H-10=14.6+9.4-1.7
	Gyr (H0=67+9-26 km s-1 Mpc-1) assuming ΩM=0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7. The other
	example models the time-delay doubles 1520+530, 1600+434, 1830-211,
	and 2149-275, which gives H-10=14.5+3.3-1.5 Gyr (H0=67+8-13 km s-1
	Mpc-1). Our second idea is to write the modeling software as a highly
	interactive Java applet, which can be used both for coarse-grained
	results inside a browser and for fine-grained results on a workstation.
	Several obstacles come up in trying to implement a numerically intensive
	method thus, but we overcome them.},
