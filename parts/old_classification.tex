\section{Summary of models}

Throu visual inspection of the most popular models generated for each candidate and data generated by those models we classified the candidates in four categories.
The data available is shown in \figref{SW58}.

The following sections list all the models for all the categories, each with a short explanation of the reasons.
Additionally, selected models are presented in figures for demonstration.

\subsection{plausible}

The plausible candidates fail in one category, but are quite convincing in all the others.
One particular reason for a candidate to end up in this category is that is has extended arcs, what is hard to modell with the current version of the program.
Thats why we recomend them for a following up study, for example for taking spectras or other follow up obersatories and for other modelling programs for a try.


\lenstitle{SW01 (ASW0004dv8)}

\subsubsection{grouplens}

\lenstitle{SW36 (ASW000096t)}
(like 4dv8 collective modelling)

\subsection{unclear}

This categy contains the ones that are hard to say.
They might look like lenses visually, but the modelling failed or prediced additional images.

\subsection{convincing}

The canidates that looked the most promising and left little doubt about being lenses were grouped into the category ``convincing''.
In Figures \ref{fig:SW02} to \ref{fig:SW29} we show all the convincing candidates.
Following we list the parameters, obtained applying the technique described in section~\ref{sec:parameter}

\lenstitle{SW02 (ASW000619d)}
Nice arc with counter image;
additional mass at 12 o'clock doesn't seem to influence the image.
\params{1.04}{0.32}{-5.18}

\lenstitle{SW05 (ASW0007k4r)}
The model predicts very steep central mass profile, and thus a very high lensing mass;
looks otherwise very convincing.
\params{3.80}{0.15}{52.50}
  
\lenstitle{SW09 (ASW0002asp)}
\params{1.12}{0.00}{88.39}
  
\lenstitle{SW28 (ASW0007xrs)}
Faint, but clearly visible arc and counter image;
but model sfits nicely
\params{1.04}{0.33}{66.63}
 
\lenstitle{SW29 (ASW0008qsm)}
Faint close arc, but reconstruion works very well;
parameterisation of ellypticity fails.
\params{0.73}{0.00}{249.80}


\subsection{doubtful}

\lenstitle{SW10 (ASW0002bmc)} 
  very elliptical setup, unlikley to be a lens;
  model failed totally

\lenstitle{SW18 (ASW0007hu2)} 
  model failed completly
  
\lenstitle{SW20 (ASW0002dx7)}

\lenstitle{SW22 (ASW0009ab8)} 
  very faint images, group configuration;
  model predicts additional images;
  mass ration close to unity
  
\lenstitle{SW23 (ASW0003r61)} 
  (no img)
  
\lenstitle{SW26 (ASW0005ma2)} 
  similar to SW10
  
\lenstitle{SW34 (ASW00051ld)} 
  (no img)
  
\lenstitle{SW41 (ASW0008xbu)} 
  similar to SW10. very ellyptical lens
  
\lenstitle{SW42 (ASW00096rm)}

  model not too bad, brightnesses off;
  stellar mass way too lower
  
\lenstitle{SW53 (ASW00070vl)}
