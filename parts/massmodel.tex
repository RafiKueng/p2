Alongside is a synthetic image produced by modelling.  In it, the
fitted lensed images are shown in colour, while the lensing galaxy and
extraneous objects have been reduced to grayscale.
(Figure~\figref{synthimg} in \S~\ref{subsec:sourcefit} shows a
synthetic image from another model of the same system.) These two
panels are qualitative and display no units, and moreover, the mutual
alignment of the two panels is only approximate.

Figures~\figref{SW58} and \figref{SW19} appear plausible lens
candidates.  Their morphology is similar to SW28, but the saddle-point
counterimage is not visible.  We consider these lenses plausible but
less convincing.

Figures~\figref{SW36} and \figref{SW57} are cases where modelling
failed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The middle row shows contour maps from the model.  At middle
  left, we have the arrival-time surface.
\item At middle right we have the mass distribution in the usual
  dimensionless form $\kappa$.  Again, these two panels are mainly
  qualitative: both panels are spatially registered and centred on the
  density-peak of the lens, but no scales have been included.
\item The base row supplies spatial and mass scales.  The left panel
  shows the circularly-averaged $\kappa$ of the model ensemble, with
  increasing radius (in arcsec).  The four short vertical lines
  correspond to the minima and saddle points marked in the upper-left
  panel.  The effective Einstein radius \ER is also shown.  As the radius
  scale indicates SW05 is comparatively large lens on the
  sky.
