\section{Discussion}\label{sec:summary}

This work follows up on lens candidates reported in
\cite{2016MNRAS.455.1191M} from citizen-science volunteers, with
modelling.  Volunteers role is collaborative.  No robotic competitors.

Table~\ref{tab:models} characterises each modelled system is
(i)~according to the image morphology and how clear or indistinct it
is, (ii)~whether the mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be
plausible, and (iii)~how the model mass compares with the estimated
stellar and full-halo masses.  Missing rows are due to photometry data
not available.

Figure~\ref{fig:stelmass} summarises the properties of the lens
candidates.  Most appear to have stellar and total mass typical of
massive ellipticals.  SW05 is the most massive of all the candidates,
with a galaxy-group scale mass.  Two systems, SW19 and SW42 have low
mass; the lens models are not entirely satisfactory, but seems
plausible.  If these are lenses, they are very interesting.  In
particular SW42 could be the most dark-matter dominated lens known.
