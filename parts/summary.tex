\section{Summary of models}

Now we give a concise characterisation of each modelled system,
according to the image morphology and how clear or indistinct it is,
whether the mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be
plausible, and how the model mass compares with the estimated stellar
and full-halo masses.

Table~\ref{tab:models} shows a summary of the analysis for many candidates.
Missing rows are due to photometry data not available.

\caption{Total mass in the model against the estimated stellar mass,
  alongside the values for the whole sample.  The lower-right shaded
  region is unphysical according to the stellar-population models,
  because it gives $M<\Mstel$. The upper-left shaded region is
  unphysical according to abundance matching, because it gives
  $M>\Mhalo$.  That is to say, the unshaded region is
  $0<\haloindex<1$. \label{fig:stelmass}}

SW05, SW28, SW02, SW09 and SW29 all correspond to the mass range of
massive ellipticals.  SW05 is the most massive of all the candidates,
with a galaxy-group scale mass.

For SW42 the inferred mass is at the low end of the sample.  (The
synthetic image shown is cruder than for the five previous figures,
but that does not influence the mass models.)  If these preliminary
findings are confirmed by follow-up observations, this could be the
most dark-matter dominated lens known.\todo{Check photometry of this
