\section{Summary of models}\label{sec:summary}

This work follows up on lens candidates reported in
\cite{2016MNRAS.455.1191M} from citizen-science volunteers, with
modelling.  Volunteers role is collaborative.  No robotic competitors.

Table~\ref{tab:models} characterises each modelled system is
(i)~according to the image morphology and how clear or indistinct it
is, (ii)~whether the mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be
plausible, and (iii)~how the model mass compares with the estimated
stellar and full-halo masses.  Missing rows are due to photometry data
not available.

Figure~\ref{fig:stelmass} summarises the properties of the lens
candidates

SW05, SW28, SW02, SW09 and SW29 all correspond to the mass range of
massive ellipticals.  SW05 is the most massive of all the candidates,
with a galaxy-group scale mass.

For SW42 the inferred mass is at the low end of the sample.  (The
synthetic image shown is cruder than for the five previous figures,
but that does not influence the mass models.)  If these preliminary
findings are confirmed by follow-up observations, this could be the
most dark-matter dominated lens known.
